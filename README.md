# Boxstash
Boxstash provides an implementation of the [Vagrant Cloud API](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrant-cloud/api.html) for privately hosting vagrant boxes.  It serves the specific use case of allowing vagrant end-users to download box images managed by the API service, which can be hosted publicly or privately as the service administrator sees fit.  However, unlike Vagrant Cloud, this service is not designed to be a multi-tenant, self-service API.  Nearly all of the functionality the API provides is only accessible to the admin user.  That is to say, the administrator is who may create namespaces (organizations/users in boxstash parlance), new boxes, new box versions, new box providers, release, revoke, upload, and delete.
